# Green-Coffee-Admin-Panel

The Green Coffee Company aims to provide a seamless online experience for 
showcasing and managing its wide range of products. However, the current 
process of managing product information, user registrations, and customer 
feedback is done manually or through basic platforms, which leads to 
inefficiencies and a poor user experience. At present, there is no centralized 
system in place to manage and categorize products as active or draft, track and 
maintain the number of registered users, dynamically add, delete, or update 
product details, and effectively collect and organize user feedback. These 
limitations create a need for a well-structured web-based platform that 
simplifies and streamlines the overall management process.
